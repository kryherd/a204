# Audio-Visual Integration Data Analysis

This folder contains data and analysis files that were completed and collected in Spring 2019.

For a full tutorial of the data analysis, see the [markdown file](https://github.com/kryherd/a204/blob/master/AVIntegration/DataAnalysis/FullDataAnalysis.md).

### Contents:

* `dataApril2019`: This contains all of the data collected from April 2019.
* `pilotdataFeb2019`: This contains the pilot data collected in February 2019.
* `FullDataAnalysis`: These files are the analyses that have been conducted on the full data sample from April 2019. The markdown file is readable on GitHub, while the Rmd file can be loaded straight into R.
* `pilotdata*.Rmd`: These are files that were used to check the pilot data. They are not well-commented; I would suggest looking at the `FullDataAnalysis` files instead.

### Need help?

You can email me if you want (kayleigh.ryherd@gmail.com), but Dan (daniel.kleinman@yale.edu) made most of the modeling/stats section, so I would suggest you go to him first!
