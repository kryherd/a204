# A204 Experiments

Hi! Welcome to my A204 repository. It contains all of the work I did for A204 (the AV integration grant) in the 2018-2019 academic year. Hopefully this repository will help you use this work for future iterations of the grant.

## Point-Light Behavioral Version

This experiment was a behavioral version of the AV integration task. It was run at SCSU in Spring 2019. For an overview of this project, click [here](https://github.com/kryherd/a204/tree/master/AVIntegration).

## HeARS Behavioral Pilot

This experiment is a behavioral pilot of the HeARS app, just to get a sense for how children in the target age range complete the task. For more information, click [here](https://github.com/kryherd/a204/tree/master/HEARS).
